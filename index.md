# E6156 - Topics in Software Engineering: Cloud Native Applications

## Overview

This course covers core, fundamental concepts in developing modern, cloud native application development.
The core topics include:

-	Microservices
-	Content distribution networks
-	Infrastructure-as-a-Service, Platform-as-a-Service, API-as-a-Service
-	API management and gateways
-	Serverless and Function-as-a-Service
-	Message-Drive-Architectures, Event-Driven-Architectures
-	REST
-	OAuth2, social media integration
-	Multi-tenancy
-	SQL, NoSQL and cloud databases
-	Service orchestration
-	Application and systems management.
-	Application development best practices.

Students will learn the material by building an application in small teams.
The application will be a simple cloud application for playing fantasy baseball. 
The application includes the basics of user interface, microservices, social networking, SQL and NoSQL databases, 
REST APIs, service composition, data analysis and simple machine learning.

There will be lectures and meetings with the professor that explain and cover 
implementation technology and review the projects. 
Teams will use Amazon Web Services for the cloud platform, but the course concepts apply to 
most modern cloud platforms. Some of the specific AWS technologies the course will cover are:
-	EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, ECS
-	Lambda Functions
-	SQS, SMS
-	S3, Neptune, RDS, DynamoDB, DocumentDB, Elasicache
-	CloudWatch, CloudTrail, CloudFormation
-	CloudSearch Data Pipeline
-	IAM, Cognito, WAF
-	CloudFront, Route 53, API Gateway
-	Code Commit, Code Build
-	Sage Maker

Students may optionally choose to use additional or different enablement technology.

The final grade is based on the review of the project.
There will be interim reviews with the professor and with the class.
