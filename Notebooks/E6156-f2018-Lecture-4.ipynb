    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"Representational State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating web services. Web Services that conform to the REST architectural style, or RESTful web services, provide interoperability between computer systems on the Internet. REST-compliant web services allow the requesting systems to access and manipulate textual representations of web resources by __using a uniform and predefined set of stateless operations.__ Other kinds of web services, such as SOAP web services, expose their own arbitrary sets of operations.\" \\(Emphasis added\\).(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Non-RESTful applications surface service/domain specific operations, e.g.\n",
    "    - ```open_account(...)```\n",
    "    - ```transfer(...)```\n",
    "    - ```check_balance(...)```\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "- The uniform, predefined REST operations are the HTTP Methods:\n",
    "    - GET\n",
    "    - PUT (or PATCH)\n",
    "    - POST\n",
    "    - DELETE\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- These represent Create-Retrieve-Update-Delete operations on __resources__ identified by __URLs.__\n",
    "    - POST is Create\n",
    "    - GET is Retrieve\n",
    "    - PUT (or PATCH) is Update\n",
    "    - DELETE is Delete.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- __Note:__ People often confuse:\n",
    "    - Remote procedure call/service invocation using HTTP\n",
    "    - REST\n",
    "    - They are not the same thing.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- The six core characteristics of the REST style are:\n",
    "    1. Client–server architecture\n",
    "    1. Statelessness\n",
    "    3. Cacheability\n",
    "    3. Layered system\n",
