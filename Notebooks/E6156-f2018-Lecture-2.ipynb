    "##### First Perspective\n",
    "\n",
    "From and [excellent overview site](https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html) by SW leader Martin Fowler.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Componentization via Services:\n",
    "    - A component is a unit of software that is independently replaceable and upgradeable.\n",
    "    - Microservice architectures will use libraries, but their primary way of componentizing their own software is by breaking down into services.\n",
    "        - Libraries are components that are linked into a program and called using in-memory function calls\n",
    "        - While services are out-of-process components who communicate with a mechanism such as a web service request, or remote procedure call.    \n",
    "    - __Note:__ I do not completely agree.\n",
    "        - The microservice design focuses on the ability to have services run in different processes.\n",
    "        - Program and design to a \"out of process\" model but may deploy together, in-process.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Organized around Business Capabilities:\n",
    "    - When looking to split a large application into parts, often management focuses on the technology layer, leading to UI teams, server-side logic teams, and database teams. \n",
    "    - When teams are separated along these lines, even simple changes can lead to a cross-team project taking time and budgetary approval.\n",
    "    - The microservice approach to division is different, splitting up into services organized around business capability. Such services take a broad-stack implementation of software for that business area, including user-interface, persistant storage, and any external collaborations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Products not Projects:\n",
    "    - Most application development efforts that we see use a project model: where the aim is to deliver some piece of software which is then considered to be completed. \n",
    "    - Microservice proponents tend to avoid this model, preferring instead the notion that a team should own a product over its full lifetime.\n",
    "    - The product mentality, ties in with the linkage to business capabilities.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "- Smart endpoints and dumb pipes:\n",
    "    - When building communication structures between different processes, we've seen many products and approaches that stress putting significant smarts into the communication mechanism itself. (See [Enterprise Service Bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_service_bus).\n",
    "    - Applications built from microservices aim to be as decoupled and as cohesive as possible - they own their own domain logic and act more as filters in the classical Unix sense - receiving a request, applying logic as appropriate and producing a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decentralized Governance:\n",
    "    - One of the consequences of centralized governance is the tendency to standardize on single technology platforms. Experience shows that this approach is constricting - not every problem is a nail and not every solution a hammer.\n",
    "    - Polyglot programming, polyglot persistence, just consume the right frameworks for the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decentralized Data Management:\n",
    "    - Decentralization of data management presents in a number of different ways. At the most abstract level, it means that the conceptual model of the world will differ between systems. (Microservice own and choose their data model).\n",
    "    - Microservices prefer letting each service manage its own database, either different instances of the same database technology, or entirely different database systems.\n",
    "    - Eventual consistency versus transactional consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Infrastructure Automation:\n",
    "    - Use of [Continuous Delivery:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery) \"Continuous delivery (CD) is a software engineering approach in which teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time.[1] It aims at building, testing, and releasing software with greater speed and frequency.\" \n",
    "    - Tools automate test, promotion, ... on code commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Design for failure:\n",
    "    - A consequence of using services as components, is that applications need to be designed so that they can tolerate the failure of services.\n",
    "    - Things fail on the Internet. Get over it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Evolutionary Design:\n",
    "    - The key property of a component is the notion of independent replacement and upgradeability - which implies we look for points where we can imagine rewriting a component without affecting its collaborators.\n",
    "    - Small, continuous, incremental evolution of components (aligning with [Agile Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)) instead of release cycles.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "##### Second Perspective Event-Centric, Event-First, ...\n",
    "\n",
    "- Traditional SOA and applications focus on components being aware of and calling other components.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Event-centric model is:\n",
    "    - What can happen in the environment?\n",
    "    - Which microservices need to react to the event?\n",
    "    - What events happen because of the action?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- Much looser coupling and incremental addition or change of functionality."

    "\n",
    "- Perhaps the first and most important function of any solution is user/customer _registration_ and _authentication._\n",

    "- No matter what application scenario your team chooses, your application will need registration, login and profile management.\n",

    "        - Mobile phone number.\n",
    "        - Address.\n",
    "    - The application must verify _ownership_ of the email and phone number via confirmations.\n",
    "    - People are notoriously bad at entering addresses, and input requires cleanup and verification.\n",

    "\n",
    "- We will build a reusable, multi-tenant solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multi-tenant Software\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"The term \"software multitenancy\" refers to a software architecture in which a single instance of software runs on a server and serves multiple tenants. A tenant is a group of users who share a common access with specific privileges to the software instance. With a multitenant architecture, a software application is designed to provide every tenant a dedicated share of the instance - including its data, configuration, user management, tenant individual functionality and non-functional properties.\" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitenancy)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multitenant applications are typically required to provide a high degree of __customization__ to support each target organization's needs. Customization typically includes the following aspects:\n",
    "    - Branding: allowing each organization to customize the look-and-feel of the application to match their corporate branding (often referred to as a distinct \"skin\").\n",
    "    - Workflow: accommodating differences in workflow to be used by a wide range of potential customers.\n",
    "    - Extensions to the data model: supporting an extensible data model to give customers the ability to customize the data elements managed by the application to meet their specific needs.\n",
    "    - Access control: letting each client organization independently customize access rights and restrictions for each user.\n",
